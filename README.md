FLL Archeology Simulator

A simple archeology-inspired game made with Python + Pygame by
entirely by First Lego League Team "Ctrl + Alt + Defeat", Team 71061 (a group
of 9-11 year olds) for the 2025-2026 FLL Season.

During this project, the team learned:
 - Python basics
 - basic terminal commands
 - how to use Pygame
 - how to read and troubleshoot error messages (they got a lot of practice!)

Our short-term wishlist:
- Add the updated man image
- Change the man's position to be more realistic
- Add a cooldown between dig actions
- Add a "Start" and/or "reset" button
- Change the artifact info text box to be more readable and exciting
- Add in the info for the artifacts based on real digs (and add images!)
- Pause the game when the text box is up

Our long-term wishlist:
- Add in different tools, an "inventory", and give different tools different functions
- Add in a resource-management layer (you apply for grant funding and have to
  manage the cost of tools, permits, labor, food, etc. on the dig site)
- Add in real-world archeology challenges (war/conflict zones, floods, wildfires,
  thieves, technology outages, etc.)
- Add in different locations for different digs--make the "finds" specific to the
  dig location.
- Underwater archeology?!?
